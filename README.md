# MIE1517HW1---ANN-CNN-on-Image-Classification
Implemented foundational deep learning models to classify images, focusing on understanding neuron computations, activation functions, loss behavior, and model convergence.

1. Built and trained a custom artificial neural network (ANN) fully from scratch (no frameworks).
2. Extended to a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch for image classification.
3. Explored the impact of architecture/hyperparameter choices (layers, batch size, activation, learning rate).
4. Documented error curves, model accuracy progression, and key observations on overfitting/generalization.
